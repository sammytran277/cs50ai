# **Project 2**

In project 2, we dive into the intricacies of Google's well-known PageRank algorithm in order to explore the concepts of sampling from Markov chains and iteratively calculating a page's PageRank value given a map of how the pages are connected to each other. Besides PageRank, we explore the field of genetics by using statistical analysis techniques to predict the likelihood of someone having a particular genetic trait.
